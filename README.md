# Locality Maps Generation

Automated generation of maps in New Zealand by locality / region. These can be produced across an entire dataset. Any additional data can be added to the maps (eg: soil readings, demographic statistics, atmospheric trends, etc).

Uses all open-source tools and datasets, including:
- Python
- QGIS
- [LINZ imagery](https://basemaps.linz.govt.nz/@-41.8899962,174.0492437,z5?i=aerial) and [localities data](https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/113764-nz-suburbs-and-localities/)
